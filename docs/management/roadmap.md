# Roadmap

## Backlog

Backlog is list of items which are planned to be implemented, but not in the development line yet.
The items sit here because of some reasons, i.e. priority, lack of resources, or need more implementation details.
When the items are ready, they will be listed in [Issues](https://github.com/Polyrific-Inc/OpenCatapult/issues), either with `wip` or `help-wanted` tags.

- Web interface
- Allow to create external service instances from Catapult
- More task providers:
  - Repository provider: Azure Repo
  - Build provider: Azure Pipeline
  - Hosting provider: AWS, GCP
